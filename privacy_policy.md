## Tetris for Android Demo

### Privacy Policy - Applies to "com.a110Tetris" [the App] published in the Google Play Store

* What data is collected
  ** Aggregated or anonymized statistics about app performance, crashes and user installs/de-installs
     (i.e. adoption or cancellation) are provided by Google via the Play Store Dashboard, and this
     app is opted-into such data collection.
  ** The app itself collects no user data. Its source code is published openly at
     https://www.github.com/llaenowyd/a110Tetris, and none of this code is related to the collection
     of user data.
   
* Disclaimer
  ** The app depends on many open source libraries, which in turn also depend on many open source
     libraries. The directly-declared dependencies are mainstream, highly visible libraries and
     tools, such as React-Native, Metro, gradle, etc. The entirety of the code run by the app is
     not known to me now and is subject to change. However this stack (i.e. entirety of libraries
     on which the app depends) is well regarded by the open-source community, and no dependency has
     been selected or configured in any way to perform any kind of user data collection, beyond
     that provided by the Play Store Dashboard by Google, described above.
